    <p>My name is Patrycja Gorczynkska. If you can't tell from my 
     super long first and last name, I'm foregin. I am 100% polish.
      I was also born in South Africa! I know, crazy right?!
       </p>
    <p>
     I'm for Chicago and moved to Arizona in October 2009. I spent 
     my teens years in Fountain Hills. If you are not familiar
     with Fountain Hills, it's honestly just a bunch of old people.
     I graduated high school in 2013 and went to Scottsdale Community
     College and then transferred to ASU. I graduated ASU in May 2017
     with a degree in Elementary and Special Education. I currently
     teach 1st/2nd grade Autism with Mesa Public Schools.
