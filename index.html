            <p>My name is Patrycja Gorczynkska. If you can't tell from my
                super long first and last name, I'm foregin. I am 100% polish.
                I was also born in South Africa! I know, crazy right?!
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm for Chicago and moved to Arizona in October 2009. I spent
                my teens years in Fountain Hills. If you are not familiar
                with Fountain Hills, it's honestly just a bunch of old people.
                I graduated high school in 2013 and went to Scottsdale Community
                College and then transferred to ASU. I graduated ASU in May 2017
                with a degree in Elementary and Special Education. I currently
                teach 1st/2nd grade Autism with Mesa Public Schools.
            </p>

            <p>
              I really enjoy having a good time with the people I love. I like to hike, spend time with my cat, watch TV, and eat food. I am a BIG foodie. Some of my favorite foods are tacos, burgers, ice cream and chicken nuggets.
